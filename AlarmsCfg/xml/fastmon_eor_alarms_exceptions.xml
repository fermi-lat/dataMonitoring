  Last verification by Luca Baldini on January 21, 2010 (see GDQMQ-337).
  Over the last months we had 453/454 violations for (20, 2), 425/454
  for (21, 2) and no violations for (12, 14). These GTFEs most likely
  corresponds to areas of tower 0 in which we have many disconnected strips.

  Note by Luca Baldini on January 27, 2010.
  On top of these I'm putting back (2, 7) and (3, 7) as they're almost dead
  and would consistently fail for short runs.
