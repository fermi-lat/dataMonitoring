# This is a dummy file wich has no other use than being processed by doxygen
# for the sake of documentation.
# The algorithm is actually implemented in pErrorLogger.py and it is used
# for processing the output of the verify module only.

## @brief Count the fractional occurrences of a given error (verify module).
#
#  The number of errors is normalized to the total number of events processed
#  by the verify module.
#
#  <b>Valid parameters</b>: None
#
#  <b>Output value</b>:
#
#  The fraction of errors wrt to the processed events.
#
#  <b>Output details</b>: None
