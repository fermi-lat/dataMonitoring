 IGRF-02-01-01 17-Dec-2014 lbaldini IGRF now checking the IGNORE_IGRF_BOUNDARY environmental variable before raising an exception if the model date exceeds the model boundaries.

- IGRF now checking whether the IGNORE_IGRF_BOUNDARY environmental variable
  is defined before raising an exception if the require model date is outside
  the model boundaries (this is similar to what the IGRF implementation in
  astro is doing).

 IGRF-02-01-00 15-Feb-2010 lbaldini Bug fix for the 2k.1 issue.
- Markus updated and committed the IGRF code. It should now be fine until 2015
and deliver magnetic fields from a multipole expansion up to l=13 (was l=10).
The update is documented in some more detail in Jira.

 IGRF-02-00-00 01-Jan-2010 lbaldini Temporary fix for the 2010 issue.

Will need some work to find a decent fix.
